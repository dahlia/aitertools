aiterable
=========

This library provides a collection of small utility functions dealing
with async iterables.  You can think of it as LINQ or aitertools for Deno.

Currently it provides:

 -  `assertStreams()`
 -  `assertStreamStartsWith()`
 -  `count()`
 -  `take()`
 -  `takeWhile()`
 -  `toArray()`

It is going to have more functions later.
